## R Markdown

**(1)** What is the question that you are going to answer? (**Title**: One sentence that ends with a question mark that could act like the title of your data story),

-   How have alcohol-specific death rates varied across different deprivation quintiles from 2018 to 2022?

    **(2)** Why is this an important question? (Answer: 3 sentences, each of which has some evidence, e.g., *“According to the United Nations...”* to justify why the question you have chosen is important),

    This question is important as it highlights how alcohol related deaths are a serious issues and what factors play a part. For example my dataset is focused on the years 2018-2022 which coincided with the covid pandemic. There was a huge increase in the number of deaths meaning that mental health played a huge part in the increase due to people being isolated, away from family, dealing with death of family members or friends, unemployment etc had a toll on their mental health and led to them relying on drinking as an escape.

    **(3)** Which rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question? (Answer: Actual names of the variables in the dataset that you plan to use).

    I will be focusing on 6 columns.

-   Year of death registration

-   Male number of deaths

-   Male number of death per 1000

-   Female number of deaths

-   Female number of deaths per 1000

    *Include the challenges and errors that you faced and how you overcame them.*

-   The major challenge was cleaning up my data which took a long time. Cleaning it up and trying to import also proved to be a major issue which took a long time. One way of overcoming it was being certain how I saved the file and that everything was save in the correct file.
