As the data shows the increase in the number of alcohol-related deaths highlights how much of an issue it is and stresses the importance of what needs to change in order to tackle these numbers. There are a number of reasons for why people resort to alcohol and therefore we need to tackle what these reasons are and how to provide support.

[**Improving Support for Mental Health:**]{.underline}

Many individuals with alcohol addiction also experience co-occurring mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, or trauma. Therefore, it is essential to prioritise mental health support as a critical component of alcohol addiction treatment. This includes increasing access to mental health services, ensuring comprehensive screening and assessment for mental health disorders in individuals seeking treatment for alcohol addiction, and integrating mental health interventions into alcohol treatment programs.

[**Enhancing Access to Treatment and Support Services:**]{.underline}

Improving access to evidence-based treatment and support services is crucial for individuals struggling with alcohol addiction. This includes increasing the availability of outpatient and residential treatment programs, expanding access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for alcohol use disorder, and providing ongoing support through peer support groups and counselling services. Additionally, efforts should be made to reduce barriers to treatment, such as stigma, cost, and transportation issues.

[**Promoting Holistic Approaches to Recovery:**]{.underline}

Addressing alcohol addiction requires a holistic approach that considers the physical, psychological, and social aspects of recovery. This involves providing comprehensive care that includes medical detoxification, behavioural therapies, nutritional support, and assistance with housing, employment, and social integration. Additionally, integrating alternative and complementary therapies such as mindfulness-based practices, yoga, and art therapy can enhance overall well-being and support long-term recovery.

[**Educating and Empowering Communities:**]{.underline}

Raising awareness and educating communities about the risks of alcohol addiction and the importance of seeking help is essential for prevention and early intervention. This includes implementing public health campaigns to reduce alcohol-related stigma, providing education and training for healthcare professionals, educators, and community leaders, and empowering individuals and families to recognize the signs of addiction and access support services.

[**Addressing Social Determinants of Health:**]{.underline}

Alcohol addiction is often linked to social determinants of health such as poverty, unemployment, homelessness, and lack of access to healthcare. Therefore, addressing these underlying social factors is crucial for preventing and addressing alcohol addiction. This includes implementing policies and programs that address socioeconomic disparities, provide economic opportunities, and ensure access to affordable housing, healthcare, and social services.

In summary, improving outcomes for individuals suffering from alcohol addiction and reducing alcohol-related deaths requires a multifaceted approach that prioritises mental health support, enhances access to treatment and support services, promotes holistic approaches to recovery, educates and empowers communities, and addresses underlying social determinants of health. By implementing these changes, we can work towards reducing the burden of alcohol addiction and improving overall public health outcomes.
